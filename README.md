#facialattendance
The code provided above demonstrates the implementation of a facial attendance system using Python. To run this code successfully, you'll need to have several Python packages installed: face-recognition, numpy, openpyxl, and opencv-python.

Here's how the code works:

The code starts by loading known faces and their corresponding names from a specified directory.
An attendance log is initialized to store the attendance data.
The code captures video input either from a webcam.
The captured frames are processed to detect faces using the face_recognition package.
For each detected face, the code compares it with the known faces and determines if there is a match.
If a match is found, the code assigns a name to the recognized face and updates the attendance log with the current timestamp.
The recognized name is displayed on the frame using OpenCV.
The loop continues until the user presses 'q' to exit.
After the loop ends, the code saves the attendance log to a CSV file using the openpyxl package.
The CSV file will contain the attendance log with the names of recognized individuals and the corresponding timestamps. This log can be further analyzed or used for record-keeping purposes.

Please note that before running the code, you need to replace the example names in the known_face_names list with the actual names of the individuals you want to recognize. Additionally, you may need to modify the code to adjust parameters such as the directory path for known faces or the video source if necessary.
